  ## Description
  In this repository, I created a workout tracker. As a user, an individual is able to view create and track daily workouts. Users are also able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. Users are also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. [Check out the deployed project over on Heroku]().
